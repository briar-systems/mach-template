# mach-template

<!-- template -->
A bone stock [Mach](https://github.com/briar-systems/mach) 6.3 Hello, World,
the project `mach init` makes with every host target declared and its entry at
`src/bin/<id>.mach`, with a GitHub repository set up around it: pull request CI
on Linux, Windows and macOS, tag-driven releases with prebuilt binaries,
protected branches, and a label set.

## Using this template

```sh
gh repo create <owner>/<repo> --template briar-systems/mach-template --public --clone
cd <repo>
./setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` is run-and-delete. It runs once, removes itself in the commit it
makes, and is never needed again. If it fails partway, fix the cause and run
it again. It:

- sets the project id to the repository name, minus any leading `mach-` and
  with dashes turned into underscores, and renames the entry file to match.
  Pass an id to choose another: `./setup.sh <id>`
- removes this section from the README
- commits and pushes those changes
- creates the `main` and `dev` branches and makes `dev` the default
- allows merge commits only
- replaces GitHub's stock labels with the set below
- adds rulesets that protect `main`, `dev` and `v*` tags

It needs `git` and `gh`, logged in with admin rights on the repository.

## Build

```sh
mach dep pull .
mach build .
mach run .
mach test . --timeout 5m
```

## Workflow

`dev` is the default branch. Work branches from it as `feat/<issue>` or
`fix/<issue>` and merges back through a pull request. `main` only takes release
merges from `dev`. A `hotfix/<issue>` branches from `main` and merges into both.

Both branches require a pull request and a passing `gate` check. Neither can be
deleted or force-pushed, and pull requests merge with a merge commit. Repository
admins can bypass these rules to cut a release. Once a `v*` tag is pushed, only
an admin can move or delete it.

Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org), with
the issue number as the scope: `fix(#12): reject a negative length`.

Issues are labeled on independent axes:

| axis | labels |
| --- | --- |
| semver magnitude | `patch`, `minor`, `major` |
| kind of work | `feature`, `fix`, `removal`, `chore`, `performance` |
| where, omitted for core code | `testing`, `tooling`, `doc` |
| severity and state | `critical`, `blocked`, `parked`, `security` |
| discussion | `discussion` |

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pull requests, on Linux. It checks formatting,
builds every artifact for every target in `mach.toml`, and runs the unit tests of
the targets the runner can execute. Targets no runner executes, such as riscv, are
built, never tested. Nothing runs under emulation.

To test on other hosts before merging, such as a darwin-specific change, dispatch
it on the branch: `gh workflow run CI --ref <branch> -f runners='["macos-15"]'`.
A project whose primary host is not Linux changes the default runner list in the
`test` job's matrix.

CI checks that the project builds and its unit tests pass. Integration, load or
demo suites are not CI jobs. Run them locally.

`gate` is the check the branch rules require. It fails if any job it needs
failed or was cancelled.

The compiler version is `MACH_VERSION`, an exact release, in `ci.yml` and
`cd.yml`. Change it together with the `mach` range in `mach.toml`.

## Releases

1. Set `version` in `mach.toml` and merge that into `dev`.
2. Merge `dev` into `main`.
3. Tag `main` and push the tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.

`.github/workflows/cd.yml` checks that the tag matches the manifest version,
runs CI in the release profile on every host the project ships to (the
`runners` list in `cd.yml`, trimmed to the targets it declares), cross-builds
every artifact for every target in release, and publishes a GitHub release. Each artifact is packaged per target
(`.zip` for Windows, `.tar.gz` elsewhere) with `SHA256SUMS`. Names and paths come
from `mach build --plan`, so a new target or artifact needs no workflow change.
The notes are the version's `CHANGELOG.md` section, or generated from merged pull
requests when there is none. A tag with a prerelease part, such as `v1.0.0-rc.1`,
is published as a prerelease.
